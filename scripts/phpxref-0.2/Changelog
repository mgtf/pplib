v0.2 - 30/April/2001
	+ Added include_once and require_once as aliases for include and require

	+ Added the ability to associate author names with php files using
	  a '// filename.php - author: jsmith'
	  syntax - courtesy of Gottfried Szing

	+ Added the looking up of SQL table descriptions referenced in
	  inline comments directly from a MySQL database; added some
	  configuration options to make this work - see the sample.cfg file
	  for details.  Courtesy of Gottfried Szing.

	+ Fixed a bug with BAD_EXT where extensions such as .php~ 
	  (with the trailing tilde) wouldn't be matched

	+ Added support for relative pathnames used with require() or include()
	  so things like:
	  require("../file.php")
	  should now resolve okay if you configure INCLUDEPATH correctly

	+ Fixed a few typos

v0.1.2 - 27/July/2000
	+ Updated the parsing/handling of require and include statements
	to handle more formats.. resolve_require() still needs to
	be improved though (ie. so it handles '../dir/file.php' cases)

	+ Updated the sample.cfg file so that INCLUDEPATH references
	the current directory.


v0.1.1 - 17/July/2000
	+ Initial release
