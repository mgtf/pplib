SYNOPSIS

PHPXref parses a set of PHP files and extracts suitably formatted comments 
placed in the scripts to generate a cross-referenced set of HTML documentation 
that you can view using any web browser, with or without a web server.

Features:
* Provides an easy means of documenting your PHP scripts whilst you code
* Cross-references functions, variables, include() and require()'d files and 
  SQL table usage
* Produces a complete function, variable and (optionally) a table list
* Generates plain HTML output that can be viewed with any web browser and 
  downloaded onto the local machine for quick reference.
* Generates a client-side quick-search search box for javascript-enabled 
  browsers

Requirements:
* Perl 5.004 or later
* A web browser - Having javascript enabled provides a nice search box, 
  but it's optional



USAGE

1) Copy the contents of this tar file into a directory somewhere

2) Create a configuration file - a sample.cfg file is provided.  The file has
comments throughout; the main items you need to edit are 
SOURCE, OUTPUT, HEADERFILE, FOOTERFILE

3) Create a header and footer file and place the filenames into the 
HEADERFILE and FOOTERFILE

4) Run the script using "phpxref.pl -c config.cfg" after some crunching the 
results should end up in the directory specified by OUTPUT in your 
configuration file



DOCUMENTING YOUR SCRIPTS

PHPXref requires that you comment your files in a certain style for your 
entries to be used as documentation.

There are a few different comments that PHPXref recognizes:

1) File description:
This provides a one line summary of what the file is and will show up in the
directory listings.  To use it you should place one comment near the top of 
each file in the following format:
// filename.php - This is a description of the file called filename.php
ie. the line must begin with '//' followed by the name of the file, followed
by a hyphen and then the description.
If you need an extra line then add one in the same format:
// filename.php - This is a description of the file called filename.php
// filename.php - that needs two lines to describe it

You can also designate an author for the file by adding a line thus:
// filename.php - author: gareth,james

2) Function description:
The main reason this script exists is to provide a means of documenting each 
function in use.  Each description consists of a one line summary and a 
long description.
Example:

////
// !A short summary about what this function does
// A longer, more complete description would go here
// We might include details of what the function parameters do and what the 
// result should be, etc.
function example_function($foo) {
	...
}

Points to note:  The description must begin with four forward slashes "////" on a line
by itself.  
The one line summary must begin with "// !" (note the exclamation mark).
The remainder of the description must begin with "// " on each line
The function declaration should immediately follow the description.


If you already have documented source code, but it's in a slightly different 
style and you know a bit of Perl, you could always just change the script 
a little bit.
Have a read of the comments at the top of the script for a hint.


3) Table references:
As the parser has no reliable means of determining when you reference a 
database table in your code (ie. you may be referencing by variable, etc) you 
need to give it a hint by using a comment in the following style:
// TABLES: table1, table2, table3
You can insert these comments anywhere in your scripts.  I recommend adding 
them to the end of each function description to note what tables that 
function uses.

As of version 0.2, you can configure phpxref to obtain table descriptions
referenced in your comments by contacting your SQL server directly; phpxref
will send a 'describe <tablename>' command to the SQL server to obtain
that information.  This feature is enabled by setting the SQL server details
in the configuration file.
NOTE: This feature only works with MySQL for the time being; feel free
to make it generic and send me the patch ;-)


ICONS

The two icons used came supplied with the Apache web server and originally 
with Mosaic for X.  The Apache documentation states that they are in the 
public domain.
