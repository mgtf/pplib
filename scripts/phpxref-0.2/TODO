* Add support for PHP4 classes
* Perhaps add an option to do a purdy javascript expanding tree for the directory browser
* Re-write the whole thing (in PHP4 perhaps rather than Perl) in code that doesn't suck
* Internationalize the strings used in the code
* Add support for descriptions of variables defined in a script
